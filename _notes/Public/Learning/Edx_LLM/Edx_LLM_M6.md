LLMOps, or Legal and Ethical MLOps, adds another layer of complexity to traditional MLOps by integrating legal and ethical considerations into the management of ML assets. While traditional MLOps focuses on optimizing performance and efficiency, LLMOps extends this framework to ensure compliance with legal regulations and ethical standards. This involves implementing processes and automation to address issues such as data privacy, algorithmic fairness, transparency, and accountability throughout the ML lifecycle. By incorporating LLMOps, organizations can mitigate risks associated with legal liabilities and ethical concerns, ensuring that their ML systems are not only effective but also responsible and trustworthy.
