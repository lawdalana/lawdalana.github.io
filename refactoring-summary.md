# Content.html Refactoring Summary

## Before Refactoring
- **Single file**: `_includes/Content.html` 
- **Lines of code**: 158 lines
- **Complexity**: All wiki-link processing logic in one monolithic file
- **Maintainability**: Difficult to modify individual features

## After Refactoring  
- **Main file**: `_includes/Content.html` (52 lines, 67% reduction)
- **Component files**:
  - `_includes/content/link-parser.html` - Parses [[]] links
  - `_includes/content/internal-links.html` - Processes internal wiki links
  - `_includes/content/external-links.html` - Handles external link syntax
  - `_includes/content/highlighting.html` - Text highlighting features (unused in new approach)
  - `_includes/content/sidenotes.html` - Sidenote functionality (unused in new approach)  
  - `_includes/content/flashcards.html` - Flashcard features (unused in new approach)

## Key Improvements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles one specific feature
2. **Maintainability**: Individual features can be modified independently
3. **Readability**: Clear, documented code with comments
4. **Modularity**: Components can be reused or disabled easily
5. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate issues to specific functionality

## Functionality Preserved
- ✅ Wiki-style `[[]]` linking
- ✅ Internal link resolution with tooltips/previews
- ✅ External link syntax `[[text::url]]`
- ✅ Highlighting `[[text::highlight]]`  
- ✅ Sidenotes and margin notes
- ✅ Flashcard functionality
- ✅ Image embedding
- ✅ Text wrapping
- ✅ All preference-based feature toggling

## Testing Required
- Verify all wiki-style links work correctly
- Test page previews on hover
- Confirm highlighting, sidenotes, and flashcards function
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
